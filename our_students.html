				  <p class="review">"I really enjoyed the lessons of Breda Tunes: I was so pleased. Simon is such a nice guy, he arrived bang on time and was very patient, adapted really well to my needs and made the lesson enjoyable for me. After my vocal course I also took the guitar course as I was so happy with how everything went. I was also really happy with how easy it was to arrange the courses, and how the school fitted the teacher to my needs."</p>

				  <p class="review"> "Their teachers are nothing short of excellent with a unique understanding of your needs. I started and found that Fireworks covers the important lessons that other music schools miss. This helped us in a few weeks and they are patient. Even though I am quite challenging, my teacher teacher is very helpful. I find myself making a lot of progress and really enjoying the lessons I receive. The people at Breda Tunes are very helpful and quick in their communication, please be patient after your first application as they work hard to find you a good teacher and like me you will find it worth the wait."</p>

			  <p class="review"> "I really recommend Breda Tunes. Barbara is really easy to talk to and tries hard to find you a good teacher that will suit you. It was fantastic because I got the option of trying one teacher first to see how I felt. Barbara regularly checks in with you to see how you're doing and it is important to her that all the students are happy and I'm sure she would do her best if someone were to have a problem. I really like this school because it seems that all the teachers have very different personalities and teaching styles which means there is a teacher for everyone!"</p>

				  <p class="review">"Fine, professional service. Breda Tunes was extremely efficient and quickly found someone for my drum lessons. The teacher provided is absolutely wonderful, with a calm demeanor, supportive style of teaching and we have built a fantastic band in the music field. My teacher Daniel gives the lesson at a good pace and gives me exercises and tips to improve and acquire skills, he makes sure I fully understand the concepts before continuing. It was an enjoyable and rewarding experience. I would highly recommend them."</p>
