			<p class="smallstory verhaaltje"> At Breda Tunes we find it very important that we have good teachers who are passionate about their work. Since we are still a young company, we do not have a lot of teachers yet, but we are growing. We link our students to the right students so that the learning process can work properly.</p>

				  <p class="review docenten">â€œIt is my mission to make music lessons accessible to everyone, from young to old. I have been playing the violin from the age of 10 and this passion has always remained in my life. As a result of all the positive reactions to the workshops, we have also been able to optimize our course material and services, making us the largest music school in the Netherlands. In addition, I find it extremely important that each student is assigned the right teacher and that the student receives lessons that are adapted to his / her level and wishes. "</p>

					<h3 class="teachers">guitar teacher</h3>
				  <p class="review docenten"> "My way of teaching differs per student. If you have never touched a guitar, this is no problem; I will guide you in choosing the right learning path (for example learning musical notation or not), but in the way that you do. I listen to the student instead of the textbook for the perfect combination of efficiency and fun For non-beginners: if a more advanced student wants to discover a new style I will guide this, but also if they want to improve in the style he or she is familiar with. Everything is possible and I am happy to help you! "</p>

				<h3 class="teachers">drum teacher</h3>
			  <p class="review docenten"> "Drumming is really great and it gives a kick to play in front of full houses. My philosophy is that you can learn to play an instrument in a playful way, without having to struggle through boring theory first. That way it remains fun and motivates, so you only make more progress! I have been teaching at Breda Tunes for five years now and I think it's great, I'm not leaving for a long time. "</p>

					<h3 class="teachers">vocal teacher</h3>
				  <p class="review docenten">"After I got to know my students, and talked about their personal preferences, goals and experiences, we start with a lesson specially designed for the student. First, we always start with warming up the voice through the do induction exercises. Then we start working with a number chosen by the student, and based on this we determine the learning points. Depending on the student, we go deeper into the singing techniques and associated anatomy. I love it to be able to help pupils from young to old. "</p>
