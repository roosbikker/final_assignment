				  <p class="review docenten">â€œIt is my mission to make music lessons accessible to everyone, from young to old. I have been playing the violin from the age of 10 and this passion has always remained in my life. As a result of all the positive reactions to the workshops, we have also been able to optimize our course material and services, making us the largest music school in the Netherlands. In addition, I find it extremely important that each student is assigned the right teacher and that the student receives lessons that are adapted to his / her level and wishes. "</p>

				  <p class="review docenten"> "Their teachers are nothing short of excellent with a unique understanding of your needs. I started and found that Fireworks covers the important lessons that other music schools miss. This helped us in a few weeks and they are patient. Even though I am quite challenging, my teacher teacher is very helpful. I find myself making a lot of progress and really enjoying the lessons I receive. The people at Breda Tunes are very helpful and quick in their communication, please be patient after your first application as they work hard to find you a good teacher and like me you will find it worth the wait."</p>

				<h3 class="teachers">drum teacher</h3>
			  <p class="review docenten"> "Drumming is really great and it gives a kick to play in front of full houses. My philosophy is that you can learn to play an instrument in a playful way, without having to struggle through boring theory first. That way it remains fun and motivates, so you only make more progress! I have been teaching at Breda Tunes for five years now and I think it's great, I'm not leaving for a long time. "</p>

				  <p class="review docenten">"Fine, professional service. Breda Tunes was extremely efficient and quickly found someone for my drum lessons. The teacher provided is absolutely wonderful, with a calm demeanor, supportive style of teaching and we have built a fantastic band in the music field. My teacher Daniel gives the lesson at a good pace and gives me exercises and tips to improve and acquire skills, he makes sure I fully understand the concepts before continuing. It was an enjoyable and rewarding experience. I would highly recommend them."</p>
