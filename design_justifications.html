					<p class="text"> The colours used in the website of Breda Tunes is all based on the logo of the music school. The background of the site is always off white. Most of is times the background of the text is black. This gives the website a good contrast and makes the text and images pop out. All the headers are bold are variate between white or red. The reason for the bold font is to attract the eye of the visitor. The font is very classy, clean and easy to use font. For the quotes on the website the same font is used but in an italic style. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The testers really liked the colours and fonts and found it very pretty for the eye to watch. They liked it that the colour scheme exists of the same colours as the colours of the logo. They also liked the variation of images. </p>

					<h3 class="caption">USER TESTING REPORT</h3>
					<p class="text"> Due to the Corona Virus I was not able to gather as much as participants as I wished to gather but at least I got 10 people who wanted to participate in my User Test. Due to Corona the participants existed out of family members, friends and in-laws. All the ten participants received the paper prototype that is shown above. As this was a paper prototype I was there to assist them during the ‘think a lout’ method test. This also made it very easy because the participants could ask questions whenever they wanted to. 
					<br/>
					<br/>	
					As the landing page is the home page (index.html), I gave this paper to them as the first page. If they wanted to press a button or switch to another page I gave them the specific paper page they wanted to navigate to. It may sound a bit clumsy but it actually worked pretty well. Despite it was a paper prototype user test if gave very valuable feedback which was very useful for coding the final website. The feedback that some participants gave was all about the content visible on the website. The participants gave feedback on how the site could be more interesting for the visitors of the website. This resulted in the free trial buttons and the layout of the website for example. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The first test was conducted with all the ten participants. Some of them thought that the site was already good and had no feedback. Some others did have some constructive feedback. So after the first test I updated the feedback on the paper prototype and showed them the updated version. After I showed them the updated version they were all satisfied with the second version which became the final version. The final version can be seen in the section ‘wire frame’ and ‘second prototype’.</p>

					<h3 class="caption">MY RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
					<p class="text">We can conclude that the most important results of the test were that there is more call to action needed on the website. The participants think that this is very useful to add more call to action like buttons so that you will motivate the visitors more. Buttons will also attract the visitors more. Additionally, the participants would like to see some more personal information about the teachers. If you introduce them via a personal quote, a more personal touch will be added which creates a bond between the company and the teachers. Lastly, the participants would like to see some more general information which introduces the visitors to the specific page.</p>
