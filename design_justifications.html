					<p class="text"> Our mission is to give every child in the Netherlands access to the best music education in primary, secondary, special education and after-school care. Through our 'Music at School' program, which is taught by qualified teachers and also provides support for the teacher, the child not only learns everything about music, but also learns to play the popular instruments. From singing to DJing and from drumming to playing the piano and guitar; 'Music at School' is a broad educational program provided by qualified teachers. This program covers almost all instruments so that a child can develop his or her musical interests broadly. This focuses on 'learning together', whereby the child learns to make music together. We provide weekly lessons as well as occasional workshops at primary schools across the country.</p>
