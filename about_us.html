					<h3 class="caption">MISSION</h3>
					<p class="text"> Our mission is to give every child in the Netherlands access to the best music education in primary, secondary, special education and after-school care. Through our 'Music at School' program, which is taught by qualified teachers and also provides support for the teacher, the child not only learns everything about music, but also learns to play the popular instruments. From singing to DJing and from drumming to playing the piano and guitar; 'Music at School' is a broad educational program provided by qualified teachers. This program covers almost all instruments so that a child can develop his or her musical interests broadly. This focuses on 'learning together', whereby the child learns to make music together. We provide weekly lessons as well as occasional workshops at primary schools across the country.</p>

					<h3 class="caption">VISION</h3>
					<p class="text"> In addition to our passion for music, we believe that by investing in good education and a healthy and safe living environment, you can offer someone perspective. The Netherlands Music School therefore invests in supporting, setting up and developing development partnerships. In addition to the 1% of our turnover that we invest in these development partnerships, a student at De Nederlandse Muziekschool has the option, without obligation, to add â‚¬ 1.00 as a donation to the tuition fee to be paid every month, and therefore invest in a fair amount of money with this euro. future for everyone. Furthermore, students and non-students can of course always make a one-time donation. If you would like to receive more information about this, you can contact our customer service at any time.</p>
